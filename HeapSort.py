# âœ… What is Heap Sort?
# Heap Sort uses a Binary Heap data structure (specifically a Max-Heap).
# Steps:
#     Build a Max Heap from the array.
#     Swap the first (largest) element with the last element.
#     Heapify the reduced heap.
#     Repeat steps 2â€“3 until the array is sorted.
# ðŸ§  What is a Max-Heap?
# A Max-Heap is a binary tree where:
#     The parent is always greater than its children.
#     The largest element is always at the root (index 0).
